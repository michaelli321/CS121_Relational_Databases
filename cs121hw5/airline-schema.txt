Write the relational model schema for your airline database in this file, using
the notation we have used all term.  You can indicate primary key columns by
enclosing the attribute names in _ characters.  Include descriptions of other
candidate keys or foreign keys (if any) immediately under each relation schema.
Example:

foo(_a_, b, c)
 * b is also a candidate key
 * c is a foreign key to bar.c

-- [Problem 4]

plane_info(_aircraft_code_, manufacturer, model)

flight_info(_flight_number_, _f_date_, aircraft_code, f_time, src_airport, dst_airport, flight_type)
	* aircraft_code is a foreign key to plane_info.aircraft_code

seat_available(_seat_number_, _aircraft_code_, seat_class, seat_type, is_exit_row)
	* aircraft_code is a foreign key to plane_info.aircraft_code

customers(_cust_id_, first_name, last_name, email_address)

customer_numbers(_phone_number_, cust_id)
	* cust_id is a foreign key to customer.cust_id

traveler(_cust_id_, passport_no, country, emergen_name, emergen_phone, frequent_fly_no)
	* cust_id is a foreign key to customer.cust_id

purchaser(_cust_id_, credit_card_no, exp_date, verification_code)
	* cust_id is a foreign key to customer.cust_id

purchase(_purchase_id_, cust_id, time_date, confirmation_no)
	* cust_id is a foreign key to purchaser.cust_id
	* confirmation_no is also a candidate key

we need to represent all the three relationships of ticket_info, has_ticket, and in_purchase 
thus we use each of their primary keys as foreign keys in order to distinguish between specific
tickets to specific flights and seats and customers

ticket(_ticket_id_, price, purchase_id, cust_id, flight_number, f_date, seat_number, aircraft_code)
	* purchase_id is a foreign key to purchase.purchase_id
	* cust_id is a foreign key to traveler.cust_id
	* flight_number is a foreign key to flight_info.flight_number
	* f_date is a foreign key to flight_info.date
	* seat_number is a foreign key to seat_available.seat_number
	* aircraft_code is a foreign key to seat_available.aircraft_code
