audio_files(_file_id_, path, length)
	* path is is unique

promotions(_file_id_, promo_type, url)
	* file_id is a foreign key to audio_files.file_id


companies(_comp_id_, comp_name)

	* comp_id is a foreign key to companies.comp_id

Since each advertisement must be associated with a company,
we combine the advertisements entity-set and the has_ad relationship-set.

advertisements(_file_id_, schedule_start, schedule_end, price, comp_id)
	* file_id is a foreign key to audio_files.file_id
	* comp_id is a foreign key to companies.comp_id

songs(_file_id_, intro_length, is_explicit)
	* file_id is a foreign key to audio_files.file_id

We combine the artists and sings_song entity sets since we know 
that a song can have multiple artists. 

artists(file_id, artist_name)
	* (file_id, artist_name) is the primary key
	* file_id is a foreign key to songs.file_id

song_tags(file_id, tag)
	* file_id is a foreign key to songs.file_id
	* (file_id, tag) is the primary key

Every entry in the play-list appears in the database, and since
this is a weak entity set, we combine the playlist and in_playlist schemas.

playlist(_file_id_, _start_time_, is_request)
	* file_id is a foreign key to audio_files.file_id
